<h1 align="center">Gland</h1>

<p align="center">A progressive, event-driven Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.</p>

## Description

**Gland** is a lightweight, extensible web framework built for modern JavaScript and TypeScript applications. With its unique event-driven architecture (EDS), it offers unparalleled flexibility in creating modular, scalable server-side applications.

Inspired by frameworks like Angular and NestJS, Gland integrates an object-oriented design pattern, minimalistic dependency injection (DI), and powerful event-driven communication, allowing developers to efficiently build and maintain complex applications.

## Philosophy

Gland is designed to solve the challenges of modern web development by embracing **event-driven design** and **modularity**. Traditional frameworks often rely on tightly coupled components, which can make applications harder to scale and maintain. Gland flips this paradigm by using events to connect components, allowing developers to build systems that are:

- **Decoupled**: Components communicate through events, reducing direct dependencies.
- **Scalable**: Events can be processed asynchronously, making it easier to handle high loads.
- **Flexible**: Developers can choose when to wait for responses and when to fire-and-forget.

## Why Gland?

Gland is designed with flexibility and scalability in mind. Whether you're building small APIs or large-scale applications, Gland provides the tools to help you structure your codebase efficiently and maintainably. Its event-driven approach helps in decoupling components and improving testability, while its object-oriented philosophy ensures clear and consistent code organization.
