# Getting Started with @medishn/gland

Welcome to the getting started guide for `@medishn/gland`, a lightweight, modular web framework for building scalable, high-performance Node.js applications. This guide will walk you through the installation, setup, and usage of `gland`, including its built-in support for logging, database queries, and routing.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** for package management
- **SQL Database** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB) if using the database query functionality

## Installation

The `@medishn/gland` package includes built-in integrations for logging and SQL database queries. When you install `gland`, the necessary dependencies are automatically included.

To install `gland`, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @medishn/gland
```

## Basic Application Setup

The following is a step-by-step guide to setting up a basic application using `gland`.

### Step 1: Create a Web Server

Start by creating an entry file for your server, such as `app.ts`:

```typescript
import gland from '@medishn/gland';
import path from 'path';

const app = new gland();

// Load the configuration file that specifies routes, middlewares, and other settings
app.load(path.join(__dirname, '.confmodule'));

// Initialize the server on port 3000
app.init(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Step 2: Configure the Server

You can configure routes and other settings using a configuration file (`.confmodule`). This file defines where your route files and other modules are located. For example, in your `.confmodule`, you can specify the path to the router:

```
path=router
```

### Step 3: Define Routes

Create a route module in the `router` directory. For instance, `router/index.ts` could contain a simple route that responds with "Hello, world!":

```typescript
import { Context, Get, Route } from '@medishn/gland';

@Route('/')
export class Test {
  @Get()
  test(ctx: Context) {
    ctx.write('Hello, world!');
    ctx.end();
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Run the Server

Now you can run your server using `ts-node` or transpile your TypeScript files and run the generated JavaScript:

```bash
ts-node app.ts
```

Your web server will be running at `http://localhost:3000/`, and visiting this URL should return the message "Hello, world!".

## Adding Middleware

`gland` supports middleware, which allows you to intercept and process requests before they reach your route handlers. You can define global middleware that applies to all routes or route-specific middleware.

### Example: Adding Global Middleware

```typescript
import gland, { Context, NxtFunction } from '@medishn/gland';

const app = new gland();

// Define a simple logging middleware
app.use(async (ctx: Context, next: NxtFunction) => {
  console.log(`${ctx.method} ${ctx.url}`);
  await next();
});

// Load routes and start the server
app.load(path.join(__dirname, '.confmodule'));
app.init(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, every incoming request will log the HTTP method and URL before reaching the route handler.

## Conclusion

This guide has provided an introduction to getting started with `@medishn/gland`. With its modular architecture, support for logging and database queries, and robust routing system, `gland` is a powerful framework for building web applications.
