# Configuration Guide for @medishn/gland

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the `.confmodule` configuration file, which is used to customize the behavior of the `@medishn/gland` framework. The `.confmodule` allows you to define routing, caching, and file-watching settings that control how the framework operates.

## Introduction

`@medishn/gland` supports flexible configuration through the `.confmodule` file, allowing you to define routing paths, module caching, and file-watching behavior. This file is loaded when the framework starts, providing an easy way to configure the application without hardcoding settings.

Key use cases for the `.confmodule` file include:
- Defining where your route files are located.
- Specifying which files should be loaded as routes.
- Enabling or disabling module caching.
- Enabling file watching for automatic reloads when files change.

## Basic Configuration

The `.confmodule` file uses a simple key-value format to specify configuration options. Below is an example of a basic configuration file:

```ini
path = path.join(__dirname, 'router');
router {
    [0]: 'index.ts';
    [1]: 'test.ts';
}
cache = true;
watch = false;
```

## Configuration Options

The following sections describe the available options in the `.confmodule` file in detail.

### Path Configuration

- **`path`**: Defines the base directory where the router files are located.
  - Type: `String`
  - Default: `'router'`
  
  The `path` option typically uses `path.join` to resolve the absolute path to the directory where your route modules are stored.

  **Example:**
  ```ini
  path = path.join(__dirname, 'router');
  ```

### Router Configuration

- **`router`**: Specifies the list of route files to be loaded by the framework.
  - Type: `Array<String>`
  - Default: `[]`
  
  The `router` section lists the files that should be used as route modules. Each file is referenced with a specific index (e.g., `[0]`, `[1]`). The files are loaded in the order they appear.

  **Example:**
  ```ini
  router {
      [0]: 'index.ts';
      [1]: 'test.ts';
  }
  ```

### Cache

- **`cache`**: Controls whether the router modules should be cached to improve performance.
  - Type: `Boolean`
  - Default: `true`
  
  When `cache` is set to `true`, the route modules are loaded once and then reused from memory, reducing overhead. If set to `false`, the modules are reloaded every time they are needed.

  **Example:**
  ```ini
  cache = true;
  ```

### Watch

- **`watch`**: Enables or disables file watching. When enabled, the framework will automatically reload route modules if changes are detected in the files.
  - Type: `Boolean`
  - Default: `false`
  
  When `watch` is set to `true`, the framework watches the route files for changes. If any file is modified, it will be reloaded automatically. This is useful during development but may not be necessary in production.

  **Example:**
  ```ini
  watch = false;
  ```

### Example

Here is a full example of a `.confmodule` file with all options:

```ini
path = path.join(__dirname, 'router');
router {
    [0]: 'index.ts';
    [1]: 'test.ts';
}
cache = true;
watch = false;
```

## Best Practices

- **Separate configuration files by environment**: Create multiple configuration files for different environments (e.g., `.confmodule.dev` for development, `.confmodule.prod` for production) and load them based on the current environment.

- **Use `cache` in production**: Caching the modules improves performance by reducing the need to reload them on each request. This is particularly useful for production environments.

- **Enable `watch` during development**: Automatically reloading route modules when files change can speed up the development process by reducing the need for manual restarts.

- **Keep the configuration simple**: Only include essential options in your `.confmodule` file to maintain clarity and avoid complexity.
