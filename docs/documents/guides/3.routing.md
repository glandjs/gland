# Routing Guide for @medishn/gland

This guide provides a complete and comprehensive overview of the routing system in `@medishn/gland`. In this framework, routing is defined using decorators for HTTP methods, middleware, and GraphQL operations, allowing for clean and maintainable code. This document will cover the various route decorators, the usage of middleware at different levels, and how to define routes and apply middleware effectively.

## Introduction

In `gland`, routing is implemented using decorators, which are annotations placed above class methods or classes to define routes, middleware, and other HTTP-related behaviors. These decorators simplify the process of defining routes and enhance the readability of your code.

Routes can be applied to methods using specific HTTP method decorators, such as `@Get`, `@Post`, `@Put`, and others. You can also apply middleware at different levels using `@mid`, `@mids`, and `Gmid` decorators, depending on the scope of the middleware.

The routing system supports both RESTful operations and GraphQL requests, making it highly flexible for different API needs.

## Route Decorators

The following are the supported route decorators in `gland`, each corresponding to an HTTP method or route handler. These decorators are applied to class methods and are responsible for defining the route paths and behaviors.

### @Get

The `@Get` decorator is used to define a route that responds to HTTP `GET` requests. It is typically used for retrieving data or performing read-only operations.

```typescript
@Get("/users")
public getUsers(ctx: Context) {
   ctx.write({ users: [...] });
   ctx.end()
}
```

### @Post

The `@Post` decorator defines a route that handles HTTP `POST` requests, commonly used to create new resources.

```typescript
@Post("/users")
public createUser(ctx: Context) {
  const userData = ctx.body;
   ctx.write({ message: "User created successfully." });
   ctx.end()
}
```

### @Put

The `@Put` decorator is for HTTP `PUT` requests, typically used for updating an existing resource. This method generally replaces the entire resource with the new data.

```typescript
@Put("/users/:id")
public updateUser(ctx: Context) {
  const { id } = ctx.params;
  const updatedData = ctx.body;
  // Update user with given ID
  ctx.write({ message: `User ${id} updated successfully.` });
  ctx.end()
}
```

### @Delete

The `@Delete` decorator is used for HTTP `DELETE` requests, usually to remove a resource.

```typescript
@Delete("/users/:id")
public deleteUser(ctx: Context) {
  const { id } = ctx.params;
  // Delete the user with given ID
  ctx.write({ message: `User ${id} deleted successfully.` });
  ctx.end()
}
```

### @Patch

The `@Patch` decorator handles HTTP `PATCH` requests, used to partially update a resource.

```typescript
@Patch("/users/:id")
public partiallyUpdateUser(ctx: Context) {
  const { id } = ctx.params;
  const updateFields = ctx.body;
  // Partially update user with given ID
  ctx.write({ message: `User ${id} updated successfully.` });
  ctx.end()
}
```

### @Head

The `@Head` decorator is used for HTTP `HEAD` requests, similar to `GET` but without the response body. It is typically used for checking resource metadata.

```typescript
@Head("/users")
public headUsers(ctx: Context) {
  ctx.headers.set("Content-Length", "1024");
  ctx.end()
}
```

### @Options

The `@Options` decorator handles HTTP `OPTIONS` requests, often used for preflight checks in cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

```typescript
@Options("/users")
public optionsUsers(ctx: Context) {
  ctx.headers.set("Allow", "GET, POST, OPTIONS");
}
```

### @All

The `@All` decorator defines a route that responds to all HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).

```typescript
@All("/ping")
public handleAllRequests(ctx: Context) {
  ctx.write({ message: "Pong!" });
  ctx.end()
}
```

### @Route

The `@Route` decorator defines a base route for the entire class. It is used to prefix all methods within the class with a specific route path.

```typescript
@Route("/users")
class UserController {
  @Get("/")
  public getUsers(ctx: Context) {
    ctx.write({ users: [...] });
    ctx.end()
  }

  @Post("/")
  public createUser(ctx: Context) {
    const userData = ctx.body;
    ctx.write({ message: "User created." });
    ctx.end()
  }
}
```

In this example, both methods would be available at `/users` , respectively.

## Middleware Decorators

Middleware in `gland` is used to process requests before they reach the route handler. Middleware can be applied at three levels: method-level (`@mid`), class-level (`@mids`), and file-level (`Gmid`).

### @mid

The `@mid` decorator is applied to individual methods to execute middleware before the route handler is invoked. Middleware functions passed to `@mid` receive the `Context` object and a `next` function, which is called to continue the request cycle.

```typescript
@mid(authenticate)
@Get("/profile")
public getProfile(ctx: Context) {
  ctx.write({ profile: {...} });
  ctx.end()
}
```

In this case, the `authenticate` middleware will be executed before the `getProfile` method.

### @mids

The `@mids` decorator is applied to an entire class and runs middleware before any methods in the class are executed.

```typescript
@mids(logRequest)
@Route("/users")
class UserController {
  @Get("/")
  public getUsers(ctx: Context) {
    ctx.write({ users: [...] });
    ctx.end()
  }

  @Post("/")
  public createUser(ctx: Context) {
    const userData = ctx.body;
    ctx.write({ message: "User created." });
    ctx.end()
  }
}
```

In this example, `logRequest` middleware will run before any of the methods in the `UserController` class.

### Gmid

The `Gmid` decorator is applied at the file level and executes middleware for every route defined in that file. It ensures that the middleware applies to all classes and methods in the file.

```typescript
// example.ts

Gmid(globalAuth);

@mids(localLog)
@Route('/test')
class TestController {
  @Get()
  public testMethod(ctx: Context) {
    ctx.write({ message: 'Test method.' });
    ctx.end()
  }
}
```

Here, `globalAuth` will be applied to every route in the `example.ts` file, while `localLog` will only apply to the `TestController` class.

## Best Practices

- **Use `@Route` for base paths**: Apply `@Route` to classes to organize and structure your routes logically.
- **Apply middleware at appropriate levels**: Use `@mid` for method-specific middleware, `@mids` for class-level middleware, and `Gmid` for file-level middleware to maintain clean and efficient code.
- **Avoid deep nesting**: Keep middleware simple and avoid deep nesting to maintain readability.
- **Use `@All` wisely**: Reserve `@All` for endpoints that need to handle
