# Overview of @medishn/gland

`@medishn/gland` is a lightweight, modular web framework designed to streamline the development of Node.js applications. Built for developers who value performance, flexibility, and ease of use, `gland` offers a powerful foundation for building APIs, web services, and other web applications.

## Key Features

1. **Modular Architecture**: `gland` adopts a modular design, allowing developers to load and configure routes, middleware, and other components dynamically through a simple configuration file (`.confmodule`).

2. **Routing with Decorators**: Define your routes using TypeScript decorators like `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Put()`, `@Delete()`, and `@Route()`. This makes your code cleaner and more declarative.

3. **Middleware Support**: Add and manage middleware easily at both global and route levels. Middleware functions can intercept and manipulate requests and responses, providing flexibility in handling authentication, logging, and more.

4. **Integrated Logger**: `gland` comes with an integrated logger from the `@medishn/gland-logger` package, allowing for seamless logging with customizable log levels. Whether logging to the console or implementing more advanced logging strategies, the logger provides robust support for tracking and debugging.

5. **Performance-Focused**: Optimized for performance, `gland` can process a high volume of requests with minimal overhead. Recent benchmarks show exceptional performance with low average response times, even under heavy loads.

## Use Cases

- **API Development**: Perfect for building RESTful APIs or GraphQL backends with support for decorators and middleware.
- **Web Services**: Build microservices with ease, leveraging the modular architecture to scale your services independently.
- **Enterprise Applications**: With SQL database integration and robust logging, `gland` is well-suited for large-scale enterprise applications.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use `gland` to create a basic web server:

```typescript
import path from 'path';
import gland from '@medishn/gland';

const app = new gland();
app.load(path.join(__dirname, '.confmodule'));

app.init(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

In the configuration file (`.confmodule`), define the path to your routes and other settings:

```ini
path=router
```

And in your routing module:

```typescript
import { Context, Get, Route } from '@medishn/gland';

@Route('/')
export class Test {
  @Get()
  test(ctx: Context) {
    ctx.write('hello world');
    ctx.end();
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

`@medishn/gland` is a versatile and efficient framework that helps developers build modern web applications with ease. Its modular design, performance optimizations, and built-in support for logging and database management make it an excellent choice for both small projects and large-scale enterprise applications.
